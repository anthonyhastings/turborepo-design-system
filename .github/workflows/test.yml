      # Turborepo attempts to run as many tasks as possible over all available CPU's.
      # This causes problems when multiple Cypress tasks run concurrently as each tries
      # to instantiate xvfb and only one can do so. The solution is to start the process
      # beforehand and set the DISPLAY environment variable which stops Cypress from
      # attempting to instantiate xvfb itself. Multiple processes of Cypress can share
      # the same instance of xvfb.
